Project 1

This project should be turned by 11PM on Sunday, Oct 2.

To submit your work attach it as a tar file or a zip file
and e-mail it to both the TAs and to me. The subject line
should contain the string "CS 28510".

You should write a code to approximate the integrals of a
function f(x) on an interval [a,b] to a specified
tolerance. The technique that you should use is an adaptive
trapezoidal rule.

A function computes a coarse and fine approximation of the
integral using one and two intervals of the trapezoidal
rule. If certain conditions are met, the fine approximation
is returned as the value.  If the conditions are not met,
the function returns the sum of the two values of calling
itself on the two halves of the interval in question with
one half the tolerance. You need to keep track, some how, of
the depth or level of the recursion. For a fine
approximation to be "good" at least one of the following
conditions should be met:

  1. The level should be at least minLevel, and the
     difference between the two approximations should be no
     more than three times the tolerance.
  2. The level is at least maxLevel.

A reasonable value for maxLevel is 30.

It might seem that each call to this function at each
level requires three function evaluations, but by passing
the function values on the ends of the interval, this
can be reduced to approximately one.

What to Show for an Example

For each example show the following plots:

  A. log of the number of function evaluations vs log(1/tol)
  B. log(1/actual error) vs log(1/tol)
  C. -log(good interval length) vs x for one value of tol.

I suggest using tolerances from 1.0e-2 to 1.0e-6.
I used 1e-2, 3e-3, 1e-3, 3e-4, 1e-4, 3e-5, 1e-5, 3e-6, 1e-6.
The "actual error" can be computed by using a much smaller
tolerance to get the "exact" result.

Examples:
 f(x) = x^2 on [0,2]
 f(x) = sqrt( sin( pi x/2)) on [0,1]
 f(x) = x^4 on [-1,1]
 f(x) = 1 if x<0.5 and 0 if x>=0.5 on [0,1]


An improved result: what happens if you return, instead of the
fine approximation (4* fine - coarse)/3? Plots A and C don't
change, but what about B?
